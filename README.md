# EnglishHindiTranslationNLP
  - Aimed to create a language translator for translating Hindi to English and vice versa for customer support systems
  - Trained an LSTM model on IIT-B Hindi-English corpus for short sequence translation (Bleu score 50.03)
  - Finetuned XLM-Roberta for longer sequence translation to cover all the corner cases (Bleu score 59.3)
  - Finally built a module of both models with a Web API using flask to make the project ready for final deployment


# Additional Info
 - This repo doesn't contain all code 
 - the code for XLM Roberta was not allowed to be posted by the company
